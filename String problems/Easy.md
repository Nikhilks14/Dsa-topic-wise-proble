## Problem 1: Valid Palindrome II

**Description:** Given a string, write a function to determine if it is a valid palindrome. You may delete at most one character to make it a palindrome.

**Example 1:**
Input: "aba"
Output: True
Explanation: The string "aba" is already a palindrome.

**Example 2:**
Input: "abca"
Output: True
Explanation: By removing 'c', the string "abca" becomes a palindrome ("aba").

**Constraints:**
- The input string will consist of only lowercase letters.
- The length of the string will not exceed 5000.

## Problem 2: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

**Description:** Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "abc".

**Example 2:**
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "b".

**Constraints:**
- The input string will consist of only lowercase and uppercase letters.
- The length of the string will not exceed 10^4.

## Problem 3: Minimum Window Substring

**Description:** Given two strings, S, and T, find the minimum window in S, which will contain all the characters in T.

**Example 1:**
Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window containing all characters in T is "BANC".

**Example 2:**
Input: S = "a", T = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no window containing all characters in T.

**Constraints:**
- The input strings will consist of only uppercase and lowercase letters.
- The length of the strings will not exceed 10^5.

## Problem 4: Word Search

**Description:** Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid. The word can be constructed from adjacent letters, horizontally or vertically.

**Example 1:**
Input:
board = [
['A','B','C','E'],
['S','F','C','S'],
['A','D','E','E']
]
word = "ABCCED"
Output: True
Explanation: The word "ABCCED" can be formed by starting from 'A' and moving right, down, and down.

**Example 2:**
Input:
board = [
['A','B','C','E'],
['S','F','C','S'],
['A','D','E','E']
]
word = "SEE"
Output: True
Explanation: The word "SEE" can be formed by starting from 'S' and moving down, right, and right.

**Constraints:**
- The board will have a maximum size of 200x200.
- The word will have a maximum length of 10^3.
