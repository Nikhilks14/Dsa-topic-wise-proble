<div style="color: green;"><h2>Problem â€“ 5 : Two Sum II - Input array is sorted</h2></div>
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
<h3 style="color: purple;">Example 1:</h3>
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [1, 2]

Explanation: nums[1] + nums[2] equals 7 + 11, which is equal to the target 9.

<h3 style="color: purple;">Example 2:</h3>
Input: nums = [-2, -1, 0, 3, 5, 9, 11], target = 8
Output: [2, 5]

Explanation: nums[2] + nums[5] equals 0 + 9, which is equal to the target 8.

<div style="color: green;"><h2>Problem â€“ 6 : Move Zeroes</h2></div>
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
<h3 style="color: purple;">Example 1:</h3>
Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

Explanation: The array after moving zeroes becomes [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].

Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true

Explanation: The given string is a palindrome when ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case sensitivity.

<h3 style="color: purple;">Example 2:</h3>
Input: "race a car"
Output: false

Explanation: The given string is not a palindrome when ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and case sensitivity.

<div style="color: green;"><h2>Problem â€“ 8 : Container With Most Water</h2></div>
Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i are at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis, forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
<h3 style="color: purple;">Example 1:</h3>
Input: [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
Output: 49

Explanation: The maximum area of water that can be contained is formed by lines at indices 1 and 8, containing 8 units of water and having a distance of 8-1=7 between them.

<h3 style="color: purple;">Example 2:</h3>
Input: [4, 3, 2, 1, 4]
Output: 16

Explanation: The maximum area of water that can be contained is formed by lines at indices 0 and 4, containing 4 units of water and having a distance of 4-0=4 between them.
